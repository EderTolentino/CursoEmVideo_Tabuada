TABUADA

This page is part of a sequence of five exercises done in the CURSO DE JAVA SCRIPT of the CURSO EM V√çDEO channel of Professor Gustavo Guanabara. This course was very useful to start learning how to edit CSS inside JavaScript functions.

Although simple, this course was very didactic to learn the concepts that were proposed.

This fourth project in this course has as input a number and as output a list of the multiplication table of this number multiplied between 1 and 100.
